# Budget tracker app ðŸ’°ðŸ’³

This is a simple React CRUD app that is built around budgeting. I built this project through online tutorials to help me learn React to learn about React Hooks, Contexts and custom components.

The <a href="https://budget-tracker-three.vercel.app/">app</a> has the ability to:
- Add expenses
- Remove exepenses
- Categorise expenses
- Totals
- Budgets
